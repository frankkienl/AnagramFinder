AnagramFinder
=============

This may help you solve words games.

So for example,   
you get a bunch of letters (in random order),
and need to find as many words possible,  
you can make using those letters.  

Then this is the software for you.

This will not help you with games like Boggle, 
as the letters would need to connect, and there's no way for this software to know that.

How to use:
-----------

- Run the program
- Fill in the letters
- Hit enter
- The program will print a list of words that can be made from those letters

How it works:
-------------
This program contains a list of English words, 
and filters out the words that are too short, too long, or contain letters that are not available.

The list of words was found here:
